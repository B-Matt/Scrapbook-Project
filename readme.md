# Scrapbook Project
## Image sharing community 

Scrapbook project is based on Laravels framework. It was a project for PHP academy where we should make a page like Instagram. 

Scrapbooks design is clean mobile responsive because it is powered by Bootstrap and custom CSS. Site is made in 2 weeks (I've worked on it after lectures and hobby so don't judge). 

- Image filter preview Scrapbook do it on client site without uploading photos many times (preview is cached) it only uploads photo after hitting "Upload" button. Program creates two set of images: thumbnail (293x293) and full(1080x1080) for previewing image or downloading it. 
- Scrapbook has custom made like (here we call it Lovers sys) and commenting systems. Only registered users can love and/or comment any public photos (yes we have private photos to!). 
- You can also use hashtag in description of photo and then other users can search your hashtag for similar photos!
